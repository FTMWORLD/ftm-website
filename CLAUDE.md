# FTM website: rules for every session

Read HANDOFF.md section 00 first.

## Translations (owner instruction, 10 October 2026)
Every customer-facing text must be live in all 50 languages at the same moment it is live in English.
- When you add or change any visible text (HTML, attributes, or messages shown by scripts), add its
  translation to every `i18n/<code>.json` file in the same commit.
- Before every push run `python3 i18n/_tools/check_translations.py`. It must print
  "0 strings missing". `--list` shows what is missing.
- New messages built in JavaScript go in `i18n/_tools/source_strings_js.json`.
  Names, codes and brands that must stay English go in `i18n/_tools/keep_english.json`.
- Keep HTML tags and `{}` placeholders exactly as in the English key. Details: `i18n/_tools/README.md`.

## Before pushing
- Check every inline script in `index.html` and `performance.html` still parses.
- Keep customer replies short: the key facts only.
